            <p><span class="decoration">M</span>ount Bromo is probably one of the most famous scenic attraction in East Java of Indonesia.
                It is famous for its mgnificent sunrise views and view of volcano crater there, which is very rare to see.
                That goes well for Kawah Ijen Volcano Crater.
            </p>

            <p>Bromo is still one of the most active volcanoes in the world and there are areas that are blocked off from tourists due to its imminent danger.
                Because of that, Mount Bromo was automatically on my bucket list to be checked off when I was visiting Indonesia.
            </p>

            <p>My starting point was in Bali and I had to take a bus from Ubung Bus Terminal to Probolinggo for the first leg of the trip.
            </p>

            <p>In the early morning at Ubung bus terminal, there wasn't any ticket window and I would have to negotiate with the bus representatives swarming around the bus terminal trying to sell you bus tickets.
                One thing you need to note: No toilet breaks.
                However, you can use the toilets at the ferry. The bus will take the ferry across, reducing the hassle of buying separate ferry tickets. You can buy food on the ferry as well.

            <p>When I hopped off the bus at the terminal in Probolingoo, everything was dark.
                The streets were empty except for a few police officers walking around.
                I was actually deserted on the streets for around two hours or so.
                Only until this guy on a motorcycle came out of thin air stopped me to offer me a ride to the Mount Bromo as he was on his way there.
            </p>

            <p>This is only the beginning of the hike to Mount Bromo, but the motorcycle driver rode me through the base of Bromo before I started hiking up the  volcano th the summit. Often, tourists would take a jeep to get to the base of the Bromo and I saw plenty of them passing my ride while I get to enjoy and absorb the scenery I had while riding. No regrets here.
            </p>

            <p>
            There were high winds I was there. It was so early, I could see the mist and fog all over the area.
            The sun was still rising from the ground.

              I had to walk up a steep, windy path, but then I took the risk to go on a dangerous off-path to beat the slow people walking up the path. The off-paths was somewhat easier because I wasn't walking on the path where horses tend to walk and pass me. The sand was too soft, so it became exhausting to walk on it upwards. So, the path I took had more solid surface where it was more comfortable for me to hike up at my own pace. Besides, I was lucky to have an excellent hiking boots.
            </p>

            <p>
              Due to the high altitude, it became harder to breath as I go up. I was panting like a dog when I got at the top. It was quite challenging even for someone as fit as me. The views from the top were gorgeus, although still very dangerous.
